Note: I wasn't able to make the graphs and tables in excel on time.
Note: Here are the answers to the questions.

1.) What is the worst-case running time of the sorting algorithm? Explain.
	Mergesort:
	-The worst-case running time for mergesort is n log(n) because it takes many iterations to complete.

	Quicksort:
	-The worst-case running time for quicksort is n^2 because of its unbalanced partitions.

2.)What is the average-case running time of the sorting algorithm? Explain.
	Mergesort:
        -The average-case running time for mergesort is n log(n) because the running times during the best and worst cases are also n log(n).

	Quicksort:
        -The average-case running time for quicksort is n log(n) when there is a 3 to 1 split between worst and best cases.

3.)What is the best-case running time of the sorting algorithm? Explain.
	 Mergesort:
        -The best-case running time for mergesort is also n log(n) because it can take half the iterations to complete as it does in its worst case.

        Quicksort:
        -The best-case running time for quicksort is n log(n) when its partitions are as evenly balanced as possible.

4.)Is the sorting algorithm stable? If not, why?
	Mergesort:Yes, because it is stable by nature.

	
	Quicksort:No, because the relative order of the items is not exactly preserved.
